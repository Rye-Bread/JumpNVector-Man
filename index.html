<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A spacey platformer with the mighty vectorpack because I ran out of time for the bigger project I was working on.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Hopefully they won't be bored.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You may press the left and right arrow keys to move left and right, and may do this even in the air. Press the up key to jump. If you hold the down key, the VectorpackTM will activate, sending the astronaught towards the location of the mouse. You may use it on the ground or in the air, but you have a limited charge which regenerates when not in use. Do note that you cannot spam the VectorpackTM in the air for cheap levitation. You may press M to mute the music and N to re-enable it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Platforming, at it's finest.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The VectorpackTM proprietary platoforming cheating device, a whole new, never seen before, recolored astro-dude sprite sheet(It still took 2 hours), and an original music track by Chris Karsch.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Mars.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Mars. You are on Mars. You continue to be on Mars. You are not sure if you will cease being on Mars. In fact, you are hoping that if you ceased to be on Mars it would not result in a cease of existence but rather a relocation to another place except Mars. You do not regret or dislike being on Mars, but you would rather exist thank you very much.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
0-infinity seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Not sucking at jumping. Even if you do, you have the VectorpackTM, so there's no excuses.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Pretty much all of the assest were from phaser examples, as I literally made this in something approaching 5, or 7 hours because I ran out of time working on something that was way better than this but was completely unpresentable. Cey la vie.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Platformer phaser example game.
